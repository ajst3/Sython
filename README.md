# Sython
  Sython is a programming language similar to python, as the name suggests. The main difference is that it has explicit typing,
  scope is defined by brackets. The language is interpreted, like Python, using a tree-walk interpreter. The language is
  a work in progress. Currently the interpreter can execute variable declarations, print statements and expressions.

# To Run
  Must use Python3 to run. Create a script with the extension .sy. Run command <path_to_sython>/sython.py <script_name>
