# Sython
  Sython is a programming language similar to python, as the name suggests. The main difference is that it has explicit typing,
  scope is defined by brackets. The language is interpreted, like Python, using a tree-walk interpreter. The language is
  a work in progress. Currently the interpreter can execute variable declarations, print statements, if/else statements
  and for, while, until, do-while, do-until loops
  Latest: break, continue statements, elseif statements and pass statements

# To Run
  Add <dir_containing_sython>/Sython to Path env variable
  Create a new env variable called SYTHON_HOME and set the
  value to the same as the path var
  Must have Python3 to run
